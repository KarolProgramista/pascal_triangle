# pascal_triangle
Simple tool used to generate pascal triangle

## Compilation
Simply type ``make`` to compile C source.

## Usage
### Generating numbers
Firstly, run ``main [amount_of_levels]`` to generate pascal triangle with desired amount of levels. 
Genereted numbers will be saved to ``pascaltree.txt``. These are just numbers with no formating 

### Formating (WiP!!)
Run ``pascal_format.py`` to get formated pascal triangle (so it looks like a triangle, kinda). 
It will also create pascaltree_f.txt that is empty for now and will contain the triangle in future.
